  <h3>What information we collect from you</h3>
  <h4>In General.</h4>
  <p>We receive and store any information you enter on our Website or give us in any other way. This includes information that can be used to identify you as an individual or to contact you directly (&quot;<strong>personal information</strong>&quot;).</p>
  <p>Personal information includes information you provide us such as your first and last name, telephone number, postal and email addresses, user name and password, and billing information (such as your credit card number, cardholder name, and card expiration date). We may also request information about your travel plans, style, and preferences, including meal requests, seat selection, frequent flyer/hotel/car rental program information, and flight class, luggage, and ticketing options.</p>
  <p>You can choose not to provide this personal information to us, but in general some information about you is required in order for you to receive relevant offerings from killjoy.co.za and its partners and enjoy other benefits of being a registered member. For example, only registered members are able to post travel reviews, participate in discussion forums, email killjoy.co.za content to themselves and others, access members-only newsletters and travel planning content, and enter surveys, contests, or sweepstakes. In addition, some information is also required in order for you to ask us a question or initiate other transactions on our site.</p>
  <p>Other information we may choose to collect may also include details such as your IP address, information identifying your device, and website browsing history to the extent that information is about you.</p>
  <h4>Information About Others.</h4>
  <p>You will have the opportunity to provide contact and travel-related information for other people through our Website. If you make a reservation for someone else through killjoy.co.za, you will need to submit that individual's personal information. You must obtain the consent of other individuals prior to providing us with their personal information, as any access to view or modify their information will be available only through your account.</p>
  <h4>Information from Other Sources.</h4>
  <p>We also may periodically obtain information about you from affiliated entities, business partners and other independent third-party sources and add it to other information about you. For example, if you visit killjoy.co.za by &quot;clicking through&quot; from a site operated by one of our business partners, and you have registered with that partner, then information about you that you have provided to that partner may be shared with us, such as contact information and demographic information. As another example, if you access third party services, such as social media services, through our Website or before coming to our Website, we may collect information such as your user name, password, and other information made available to us through those services. We will work with our existing partners and potential future partners to improve and personalize your use of our Website in accordance with the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
  <p>We have partnered with Facebook to provide personalized content on killjoy.co.za for members of Facebook. If you are logged into Facebook and killjoy.co.za, killjoy.co.za will be personalized for you when you visit the Website, even if you are a first-time user of killjoy.co.za's Website. For example, we will show you reviews that your Facebook friends have posted on killjoy.co.za and places they have visited. In order to provide you with this personalized experience, Facebook provides us with information that you have chosen to make available pursuant to your Facebook privacy settings. That information may include your name, profile picture, gender, friend lists and any other information you have chosen to make available.</p>
  <p>If you decide to turn off personalization, you can do so by first logging into Facebook and (1) selecting &quot;Edit your profile&quot; from the &quot;Your killjoy.co.za&quot; drop-down menu on the <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.za/memberprofile">Member Profile</a> page and clicking &quot;Disconnect&quot; in the Facebook Connect status box, or (2) selecting &quot;Connected accounts&quot; from the &quot;Your killjoy.co.za&quot; drop-down menu on the <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.za/memberprofile">Member Profile</a> page and clicking &quot;Disconnect&quot; under &quot;Facebook Settings.&quot; You can also turn off personalization by editing your app settings on Facebook. Please note that if you have Facebook friends who are using killjoy.co.za, they may also have shared information about you with us through Facebook. If you wish to prevent that sharing, you can do so by editing your Facebook privacy settings.</p>
  <h4>Automatic Collection of Information.</h4>
  <p>We automatically collect some information from your computer or Device when you visit killjoy.co.za. For example, we will collect session data, including your IP address, Web browser software, and referring website. We also may collect information about your online activity, such as content viewed, pages visited, and searches and/or reservations facilitated or made. One of our goals in collecting this automatic information is to help us understand the interests and preferences of our users and customize your user experience.</p>
  <h4>Payment Information.</h4>
  <p>If you make travel reservations with third-party suppliers facilitated by killjoy.co.za, we will collect payment information from you, including your credit card number, cardholder name, expiration date, authentication code, and billing address. We will securely transmit this information to the supplier of the travel reservation to complete the transaction. Please note that the supplier processes your payment, not killjoy.co.za, unless otherwise specified. You agree to review and be bound by the supplier's policies and procedures before making a reservation through killjoy.co.za. We may offer members the option to save information related to method and choice of payment on our Website. If you save such payment details on killjoy.co.za, you will be able to add, delete, or modify that information at any time in Account Settings.</p>
  <p><a name="loc" id="loc"></a></p>
  <h4>Location Information and Other Information from Devices.</h4>
  <p>When you use an Application on a Device, we will collect and use information about you in generally similar ways and for similar purposes as when you use the killjoy.co.za website. In addition, we may collect information about your location if you have instructed your Device to send such information to the Application via the privacy settings on that Device, or if you have uploaded photos tagged with location information. We may use the location information collected from your Device or photos to enhance your use of the Application by providing you with relevant content and contextual advertising. For example, we may use your location to show you reviews of hotels or restaurants near you when you are traveling. You can change the privacy settings of your Device at any time, in order to turn off the functionality to share location information with the Application and/or the functionality to tag your photos with location information. Please note that turning off location sharing may affect certain features of our App. If you have any queries about the privacy settings of your Device, we suggest you contact the manufacturer of your Device or your mobile service provider for help.</p>

  <h4>Cookies and Other Web Technologies.</h4>
  <p>We collect information via cookies and other similar technologies (such as web beacons). Cookies are small text files that are automatically placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit almost any website. They are stored by your Internet browser. Cookies contain basic information about your Internet use. Your browser sends these cookies back to the site every time you revisit it, so it can recognize your computer or mobile device and personalize and improve your site experience.</p>
  <p>You can find out more detailed information about what cookies and similar technologies (such as web beacons) we use in our <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.za/cookiepolicy">Cookies Policy</a> and our <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.za/cookiepolicy">Cookie Consent Tool</a>.</p>
  <p>You can also find out more about cookies generally, including how to see what cookies have been set on your device and how to manage and delete them at websites such as <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/" target="_blank">www.allaboutcookies.org</a> and <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.youronlinechoices.eu</a></p>
  <p>killjoy.co.za, its affiliated websites, and Apps use cookies for the following general purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To help us recognize your browser as a previous visitor and save and remember any preferences that may have been set while your browser was visiting our site. For example, if you register on our site, we may use cookies to remember your registration information, so you do not need to log into our site each time you visit. We also may record your password in a cookie, if you checked the box entitled &quot;Keep me signed in on this computer unless I sign out.&quot; Please note that member IDs, passwords, and any other account-related data included in such cookies are encrypted for security purposes.</li>
    <li>To help us customize the content, experience, and advertisements provided to you on our websites and Apps and on other websites across the Internet. For example, when you access a web page, a cookie is automatically set by us, our service providers, or our partners to recognize your browser as you navigate on the Internet and to present you with information and advertising based on your apparent interests. See Display of Advertising/Your Choices for more information about our online advertising practices and your choices.</li>
    <li>To help measure and research the effectiveness of features and offerings, advertisements, and email communications (by determining which emails you open and act upon).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers should tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable non-essential types of cookies. Please note that if you refuse to accept cookies, you may not be able to access many of the travel tools offered on our sites.</p>
  <p>Our sites also may use Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or Web bugs), which are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that are placed in the code of a Web page. We use Web beacons to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our sites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, and to improve site performance. We also may allow our service providers to use Web beacons to help us understand which emails have been opened by recipients and to track the visitor traffic and actions on our site. This helps us measure the effectiveness of our content and other offerings.</p>
  <p><a name="adv" id="adv"></a></p>
  <h4>Display of Advertising/Your Choices.</h4>
  <p><em>Data collected to serve you with relevant advertising</em></p>
  <p>killjoy.co.za is committed to providing you with relevant content and information across our sites.</p>
  <p>To do this, we may collect information about your travel-related searches and other site activities, such as whether you are looking for airline flights or hotels, and use this information to serve you with ads on our sites or elsewhere online that match your interests. So, for example, if you search for a flight to Florida on killjoy.co.za, you may see an ad for a Florida travel package on killjoy.co.za or on another website you visit.</p>
  <p>We only share your personal contact information (such as email addresses) with affiliated third parties so they can serve you with advertisements. You can choose not to receive relevant online advertising on other websites, based on your travel-related searches on killjoy.co.za by clicking <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Note that if you choose not to receive tailored ads, you will see online advertisements, but they will be more general and less relevant to you. Information on our policy in relation to email contact with you is set out below.</p>
  <p><em>Data collected by business partners and ad networks to serve you with relevant advertising</em></p>
  <p>Many of the advertisements you see on the killjoy.co.za family of sites are served by killjoy.co.za or its service providers. But we also allow third parties to collect information about your online activities through cookies and other technologies. These third parties include (1) business partners, who collect information when you view or interact with one of their advertisements on our sites, and (2) advertising networks, who collect information about your interests when you view or interact with one of the advertisements they place on many different websites on the Internet. The information gathered by these third parties is used to make predictions about your characteristics, interests or preferences and to display advertisements on our sites and across the Internet tailored to your interests.</p>
  <p>Please note that we do not have access to or control over cookies or other technologies these third parties may use to collect information about your interests, and the information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Privacy Policy. Some of these companies are members of the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Network Advertising Initiative</a>, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies. To learn more, please click <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
  <p><em>Response to Do Not Track signals</em></p>
  <p>Your web browser may transmit a &quot;Do Not Track&quot; (&quot;DNT&quot;) signal to killjoy.co.za and other websites. Because of differences in web browsers' default settings and the manner in which browsers incorporate DNT signals, it is sometimes unclear to site operators whether site visitors have selected the DNT setting themselves, or whether they are aware that they have a choice in determining the setting. killjoy.co.za does not currently respond to DNT signals. Once the Internet industry has settled on standards related to this issue and killjoy.co.za recognizes such standards, we may reevaluate this approach. At the present time, our policy in relation to cookies in particular is set out below under &quot;Cookies and Other Web Technologies&quot;.</p>
  <p><a name="use" id="use"></a></p>

  <p><strong>Email Communications</strong></p>
  <p>We want to make it easy for you to take advantage of travel-related opportunities on our Website. One way we do this is by sending you email messages that contain information about your travel-related interests in accordance with your marketing preferences. For example, if your marketing preference is to receive email marketing messages, then if you search for a flight to New York on our website, we may send you an email message about airfares and travel to New York or other destinations. We believe these email messages will provide you with useful information about travel-related special offers available through our sites. Please note that you will have the opportunity to choose not to receive these email messages in any such email we send.</p>
