  <p>Why is the rental property not listed in the search results?</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The most obvious cause is that the property has not been added to the rental property listings.</li>
    <li><a id="inline" href="#addlisting">Follow these steps to add a rental property listing.</a></li>
    <li>It is also possible that the property has been added to the rental property listings, but is undergoing the <strong>screening process</strong> from our editors. </li>
    <li>Another possibility is that the rental property has been added to the rental property listing, but <strong>revoked</strong> because it did not pass the guidelines in the <a href="fair-review-policy.html">Fair Review Policy</a>.</li>
    <li>As a last resort, try adding the property again, by following the steps outlined in step 2 above.</li>
  </ol>
</div></div>
<div style="display:none">
<div class="topics" id="time">
  <p>How long does the screening process take?</p>
  <p>It all depends on <strong>workload</strong>. An average editor can screen between one hundred to two hundred properties in one day. The more <strong>properties added </strong>to the property reviews and listings, the higher the work load and the longer it takes to complete the screening process. On average, any property listing or review screening should be completed withing 48 Hours, during weekdays, of submission. You will be notified by email if your property review or listing has been approved and published. You will also be notified if your property review or listing did not comply with the guidelines and therefore not published.</p>
</div></div>
<div style="display:none">
<div class="topics" id="nonotice">

  <p>The most obvious cause is that you completed a rental property review or listing, but did not sign up to join the killjoy.co.za community.

<div class="topics" id="respondto">
  <p>Why can I not view or respond to my own reviews.?</p>
  <p>If you can view your own rental property reviews it means that you can respond to your own reviews and it causes confusion in the way the public views the reviews. It also happens that some members continously click on their own reviews to collect more points. Every time you click on a review it collects points and adds a view to the total views the review receives. It may appear strange that a review with not particular interest attracts so much attention, whereas a reviews that is regarded as interesting, receives far less attention. It is somewhat misleading.</p>

  <p>How long does the screening process for a property rental offer take?</p>
  <p>It all depends on <strong>workload</strong>. An average editor can screen between one hundred to two hundred properties in one day. The more <strong>properties added </strong>to the property rental offers list, the higher the work load and the longer it takes to complete the screening process. On average, any new property rental offer screening should be completed withing 48 Hours, during weekdays, of submission. You will be notified by email if your property rental offerng has been approved and published. You will also be notified if your property review or listing did not comply with the guidelines and therefore did not get published.</p>

  <p>What is the difference between a property rental offer listing and a listing for a property review?</p>
  <p>A property rental offer listing is a listing for a property that is vacant or becoming vacant and available for letting through the owner, or through a letting agency. With this type of listing, tenants looking for a suitable property for rent can search a property rental offer by City or Town. A list of availbale property rental offers in that city and town will then be displayed. The listings are displayed by date added to the system and individual listing details can be see by clicking on any of the property rental details.</p>
  <p>A property review listing is a listing for a specific property by street address, suburb and town. With this listing tenants have the opportunity of sharing and rating their personal experience of living at this property. To view this listing, visitors must search for a property by it's street address. A list of the reviews will then be displayed in the property reviews list. More details of the review information can be seen by clicking on the View Review button below the specific review for the property. We believe this oprtion really helps future tenants.</p>

<div style="display:none">
<div class="topics" id="points">Points are allocated as follows. For every property  you review, you earn 1 point, and for every time someone views or reads one of your property reviews you also earn 1 point. You can collect points to reach new levels and receive badges. The points can also be used to contribute towards advertising campaigns, in case you wish to advertise a property for rent. You may sell a product or service and choose to advertise this product on the killjoy.co.za web site, in this case the points you collect can contribute towards paying for the advert running on our web site.</div></div>
