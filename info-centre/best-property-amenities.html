  <h1>Amenities tenants look for in a property</h1>
  <p>When renters are searching for a new property to call home, there are certain features that top their list. Having a property that contains these desirable features can help differentiate your rental from the competition. Learn what amenities will help get your property rented quickly.</p>
  <h2>1. Location</h2>
  <p>Location is and always has been the number one amenity tenants look for in a property. If your property is in the right location, you can demand higer prices without the need for much else. </p>
  <p>Renovations and square meters become secondary concerns. People are much more willing to compromise on other amenities if they are in a location that is desirable to them in some way. Think of any area close to a large city. People are willing to pay much higher prices to be in the heart of it all- close to transportation, shopping, food and entertainment.</p>
  <h2>2. Renovations</h2>
  <p>Tenants love anything that looks or feels new. Every tenant knows that the essence of a rental means someone lived in the space before them, but they don&rsquo;t want to see or feel that.</p>
<p>Think about when you buy something new, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what it is, it could be a stick of gum or a new pair of sneakers, part of the fun is that it&rsquo;s yours, it&rsquo;s clean and no one has had it before you. Tenants want to feel special in this way about their apartments and this is why renovations are so effective at getting units rented quickly.</p>
<p>Renovated kitchens and bathrooms hold particular appeals.</p>
<h2>3. open floor plan</h2>
<p>Renters love an open floor plan. An open floor plan can help a smaller space appear larger. Many feel a kitchen that is open to the living space allows for better entertaining.</p>
<h2>4. available parking</h2>
<p>For renters with cars, parking is incredibly important in a rental. Off-street parking is even more desirable. Being able to provide the tenant a spot in the driveway or in a garage will help get the unit rented quickly.</p>
<p>In suburban areas, parking is more readily available. As long as a tenant has a place to park within close proximity to the property, even if it is on-street, they should be happy.</p>
<p>For tenants with cars in more urban areas, parking will be a bigger issue. If there is not a designated parking spot included with your rental, you should make negotiations with a neighbor to provide a parking space or you should at least be able to point the tenant in the direction of the nearest parking garage. If this garage is too far away from your property, more than five or six blocks, this could be a deal breaker.</p>
<h2>4. Washing machine and dish washer waste Pipes</h2>
<p>No one wants to have to drag their dirty clothes all the way to the Laundromat. A washing machine and dish washer waste connection is a huge plus. It is common to see washing maching outlet pipes being led into the basin, bath or shower floor. In some cases it is not uncomment to open a shower curtain to only find a washing machine hidden behind it.</p>
<h2><strong>7. Closet Space/Storage Space</strong></h2>
<p>Everyone has belongings they need to put in the closet, whether it be clothes or a vacuum and holiday decorations. If your unit does not have adequate storage space, see if there is enough space to add another closet. If there is not, do you have a basement, garage or storage shed where you can allow the tenant to store their belongings?</p>
<h2><strong>8. Large Windows/Natural Light</strong></h2>
<p>No one wants to live in a cave. Why do you think realtors open all the windows and blinds when showing a property? It is to let in as much natural light as possible. Natural light will make the property look warmer and more inviting. Sunshine also helps to improve a person&rsquo;s mood.</p>
<h2><strong>9. Outdoor Space- Balcony or Yard Access</strong></h2>
<p>If a tenant has a place to braai or to sit out and read the newspaper, this is a bonus. Even if it is not a private backyard or balcony, having some type of outdoor space can help rent out a property or can allow you to charge higher rent, especiallyÂ in an urban area.</p>
<h2><strong>10. Privacy</strong></h2>
<p>We can debtate about the privacy topic for days on end, but the basis is clear, most tenants love and value their privacy. Properties with a higher privacy rating, fetch higher prices and are easier to let. Provide at least some form of privacy in and outside a property where the tenants can feel private. </p>
<p>When a tenant is renting a property or room, it is their home. The property manager/owner may need to enter for an inspection, repair or a viewing, but it is important that the tenant&rsquo;s privacy is respected.</p>
<p>There are many online resources that can help you to understand your rights as a tenant or landlord.</p>
<h2>11. Pets</h2>
<p>Pets are not only for entertainment, but also considered a vital companion to people living alone, not to mention the security benefits of having a dog. Properties where pets are allowed hugely appeal to potential tenants. Think twice about not allowing pets, you more than double your chances of finding a decent tenant. It is a well known fact that people that love pets get along well with strangers and other people. </p>
<h2>12. Services</h2>
<p>Additional services tenants look for when renting a property include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Airconditionng</li>
  <li>Internet access or a means to connect to the Internet.</li>
  <li>Telephone Line</li>
  <li>DSTV Dish or TV aerial.</li>
  <li>Alarm system</li>
  <li>Indoor braai</li>
  <li>Swimming pool or access to a swimming pool</li>
