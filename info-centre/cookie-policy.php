  <h1>Cookie Policy</h1>
  <p>At killjoy.co.za, we want to ensure that your visit to our Web site is smooth, reliable and as useful to you as possible. To help us do this, we use cookies and similar technologies (together referred to as &ldquo;cookies&rdquo; in this policy).</p>
  <p>We notify you about our use of cookies when you first visit our Web site, through a notification banner at the top of the page. By continuing to use the site, you consent to our use of cookies. However, you can change your cookie settings, and choose whether or not to accept cookies, at any time through our Cookie Consent Tool. Further information about managing your cookie settings is provided below.</p>
  <h3>What are cookies?</h3>
  <p>Cookies are small text files that are automatically placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit almost any Web site. They are stored by your Internet browser. Cookies contain basic information about your Internet use, but they do not normally identify you personally. Your browser sends these cookies back to the site every time you revisit it, so it can recognise your computer or mobile device and personalize and improve your site experience.</p>
  <p>For instance, we use cookies on our Web site to remember your login details, so you don&rsquo;t have to re-enter them repeatedly during your visit to the site. Other cookies help us to understand what did and didn't interest you about our site, so we can provide you with features that are more relevant and useful to you next time you visit. We also use cookies to analyse how visitors use the site.</p>
  <p>We work with third party advertisers to give you access to interesting and exciting travel content through our Web site. So, as well as setting some cookies ourselves - &quot;first party cookies&quot;, we also allow some advertisers who display advertisements on our site to set cookies, known as &quot;third party cookies&quot;. These cookies record information about your use of advertisements. This helps advertisers to show you advertisements that are more likely to interest you, limit the number of times you may see an advertisement and also to help to improve your online experience.</p>
  <p>Please note that our use of any information we collect about you through your use of cookies is subject to our Privacy Policy, which is linked to from the bottom of every page.</p>
  <h3>What types of cookies do we use?</h3>
  <p>The cookies we use fall into 3 categories. These categories are described below. You can find further information about the cookies in each category by accessing the Cookie Consent Tool.</p>
  <h4>Essential cookies</h4>
  <p>These cookies are necessary to help you access and move around our site and use all its features. Without these cookies, our website would not work properly and you would not be able to use certain important features. For example, we use a cookie to keep you logged in during your visit, so the site does not require you to log in repeatedly to access different pages. We also use essential cookies for fraud detection and prevention purposes.</p>
  <p>You will see that you cannot turn off essential cookies through the Cookie Consent Tool. The reason for this is that such cookies are necessary for you to access and use the content and features of the Web site.</p>
  <h4>Analytics and customisation cookies</h4>
  <p>At killjoy.co.za, we want to make your experience on our website as helpful, smooth and as enjoyable as possible. We use cookies to help us understand how our website is being used and how we can improve your experience on it. This type of so-called &quot;analytics&quot; cookies can provide us with anonymous information to help us understand which parts of our Web site interest our visitors and if they experience any errors. We use these cookies to test different designs and features for our sites and we also use them to help us monitor how our visitors reach our sites.</p>
  <p>We also use cookies to save your settings and preferences on our Web site, such as language preference and information you've previously entered when searching for travel options. Some customisation cookies are essential if you want to use certain features of the site.</p>
  <h4>Advertising cookies</h4>
  <p>Advertising cookies help ensure that the advertisements you see on our Web site are as relevant to you as possible. For example, some advertising cookies help select advertisements that are based on your interests. Others help prevent the same advertisement from continuously reappearing for you.</p>
  <p>We also want to make it as easy as possible for you to share content from killjoy.co.za with your friends through your favourite social networks. Social networking sites, such as Facebook, may set cookies that recognise you when you view content on our Web site and allow you to share content across both sites via the use of sharing settings. For further details, please see your social networking site&rsquo;s terms of use and privacy policy.</p>
  <h3>Cookie Consent Tool - managing your cookie settings</h3>
  <p>You have the right to choose whether or not to accept cookies and we explain how you can exercise this right below. We provide you with a Cookie Consent Tool, which allows you to review the first and third party cookies placed through our site and adjust your cookie settings, including whether to accept such cookies or not. You can access the Cookie Consent Tool at any time through the &ldquo;Cookie consent&rdquo; link at the bottom of every page.</p>
  <p>In addition, you can manage cookies through the settings of your Internet browser. You can have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, delete individual cookies or delete all cookies.</p>
  <p>Most advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of advertising cookies. See <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">www.aboutads.info/choices/</a> and <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/">www.youronlinechoices.com</a> for useful information on how to do this.</p>
  <p>Please note that, if you choose to delete killjoy.co.za cookies, your access to some functionality and areas of our Web site may be degraded or restricted.</p>
