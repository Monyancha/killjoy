    <h3>Follow the Guidelines below to ensure your property rental review or listing gets published</h3>
    <p>Please pay careful attention to the following guidelines before adding any property rental reviews or listings.</p>
    <h4>What you should avoid doing</h4>

      <li>Do not use <strong>swearing or degrading terms</strong> in any of the sentences used in your reviews.</li>
      <li>Do not attempt to promote any form of <strong>propoganda</strong> through reviews.</li>
      <li>Do not attempt to attack the <strong>religion</strong> of an individual or promote your religious views by expressing any religious content in any property reviews.</li>
      <li>No form of <strong>pornography</strong> or any word related to any pornographic content will be allowed through any reviews.</li>
      <li>No <strong>advertising</strong> of any products or any services are allowed through the reviews.</li>

      <li><strong>Charity</strong>. No form of any charitible cause will be allowed through reviews or listings. </li>

    </ol>
    <h4>What you should be doing</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>        Get to the point. No one has time to read essays of your personal experience of a property. Keep it short and simple and pay attention to keys points.</li>
      <li>Be polite. It is the most proven method to deal with any flammable situation. Swearing and insluting others never work. </li>
      <li>Pay a compliment where it's due. Certainly there are good aspects about the property. Let others know about it.</li>
      <li>Revise your reviews regularly. You may feel different at a later stage and your issues may have been resolved. Update the review in any case.</li>
      <li>Provide as much detail of the rental property as possible. Remember that it is your personal experience that help future tenants.</li>
      <li>Update your review regularly and provide as much feedback as possoble. Make the necessary change when and if some of your problems have been resolved.</li>
      <li>Remember, the rating or your review has a permanent reflection over the overall ratings for a property, Adjust the raring accordingly. </li>
      <li>Only you, and no one else, can delete a review. If you feel the property review is no longer necessary, delete it.      </li>
      <li>Be fair, actions speak louder than words.<br />
      </li>
