  <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent">
    <p>Please pay careful attention to the following guidelines before adding any photos to a property review or listing</p>
    <h4>What you should avoid doing</h4>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Defamation</strong> of property. Do not attempt to upload any photos thare reflect badly on the image of the property. Any photos that show damage to a property, the state of the property, or any negative illustration of a rental property, <strong>will be disregarded</strong>.</li>
      <li>Do not attempt to hide sentences of <strong>afflicting content</strong> by means of a graphic illustration or photo.</li>
      <li><strong>Profanity</strong>. We have a very strict photo profanity policy. No photo's containing cussing, nudity or any other form of vulgarity will be allowed.</li>
      <li><strong>Selfies</strong>. Don't even try. We are interested in the property behind you ;-)</li>
      <li><strong>Advertising</strong>. Any photo advertising any product, item or service for sale, will be disregarded.</li>
      <li><strong>Personal posessions</strong>. Please try your best to avoid animals, cars, clothes on a washing line, kid's toys spread about and other personal posessions in your photos.</li>
      <li><strong>Misleading photos</strong>. Try your best to add a photo of the property you are renting. Please do not add photo's of properties not related to the property rental offer.</li>
      <li><strong>Events</strong>. Do not advertise any events through the use of photo's uploaded for a property rental offer.</li>

      <li><strong>Highlight unique amenities</strong>. Promote the details tenants look for in a property.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4>What you should be doing</h4>
    <ol>
      <li> In a nutshell, only upload frontal, top, side view photos of a property. Interior and exterior photos are what count. Cell phone photos are fine. </li>
      <li>Be sure to convert your photos to the jpeg, jpg, gif or png format. </li>
      <li>Be careful. Remember that JPEG/JPG photos contain <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/203592/what-is-exif-data-and-how-to-remove-it/" title="what is exif data" target="_new">EXIF</a> data. This means that the photo you upload could contain the geodata for the location of where the photograph was taken. If you are uncertain see this article about <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/203592/what-is-exif-data-and-how-to-remove-it/" title="What is exif data and how do i remove it from my photographs" target="_new">how to remove exif data from your photographs</a>.</li>
      <li>A total of eight (8) photos can be uploaded, with a maximum of 2Mb file size per photo. </li>
      <li>Ask permission, if it is not your personal property. Not only is it the right thing to do, but it may avoid conflicts of interests.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/746/how-can-i-make-my-listing-photos-look-their-best" target="_new">See this article</a> for more guidelines on How to make your listing photos look their best.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>A very friendly reminder. We reserve the right to remove any photo or group of photos, based on our sole dicretion. <br />
